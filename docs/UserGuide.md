## Introduction

CLIpboard is a desktop app that helps educators (like you!), especially those that tutor multiple classes, by managing their studentsâ€™ particulars<strong> in an organised manner.</strong>

CLIpboard is designed to work efficiently through typing keyword commands and also has a user-friendly interface with graphical elements. It can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional apps.

CLIpboard is optimised for keyboard users, so if you can type fast, CLIpboard can work even faster.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest clipboard.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the *home folder* for your CLIpboard.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar clipboard.jar` command to run the application.&nbsp;
<br>e.g. your `clipboard.jar` is stored in the `user/app/task/` directory. You run `cd user/app/task/`, then `java -jar clipboard.jar`.
<br>A GUI similar to [<i>Figure 1</i>](#introduction) should appear in a few seconds.
<br><i>Note how the app contains some sample data.</i>
5. You will start on the `Course page` (Refer to [<i>Figure 3</i>](#navigation-guide) below for the Navigation Guide).
6. Type your command in the command box (Refer to [<i>Figure 2</i>](#visual-guide) below for the Visual Guide) and press Enter/Return to execute it.
<br>e.g. typing `help` and pressing the Enter/Return key will open the help window.
    <br>Some example commands you can try:
   1. `select 1` : Selects the first course displayed (eg. `CS2103T`) on the `Course Page`. You will be redirected to the `Group Page`.
   2. `select 1` : Selects the first group displayed (eg. `T15`) on the `Group Page`. You will be redirected to the `Student Page`.
   3. `add student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com sid/A1234567X` : Adds a student named `John Doe` with the particulars into the list on the `Student Page`.
   4. `delete student 3` : Deletes the 3rd student (eg. `Lim Kim Choo`) shown in the student list.
   5. `undo` : Returns to the state before the previous `delete student` command you entered. The deleted student (eg. `Lim Kim Choo`) should be back on the list.
   6. `exit` : Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [commands list](#commands) below for a detailed description for each command.

   * This is where you can find your list of added page objects such as `Courses`, `Groups`, `Students`, `Sessions`, 
     and `Tasks`.
5. Using the Right Pane
   * The Right Pane will appear when you are on the `Attendance Page` or `Tasks Page`. It will show the list of 
     students to mark their attendance or assign them a grade.
6. Entering Commands in the Command Box
   * To enter a command, type it into the Command Box.
7. Viewing Results in the Result Display
   * After entering a command, you can view whether it was successful in the Result Display. 
   * If your command failed, you can also find help messages with valid arguments here.
8. Checking the Status Bar Footer
   * The Status Bar Footer displays the file path from which the data is being loaded or saved in relation to the 
     location of `clipboard.jar`.
9. Checking the CLIppy Indicator
   * The CLIppy Indicator can help you know whether you are typing in a command correctly. 
   * When you enter a correct command, CLIppy will be happy. If you have a command failure, CLIppy will be sad.

## Navigation Guide

Moving between pages is easy with our navigation tools.
Simply use a combination of `select`, `back`, `session`, and `task` commands.
If you need more information on how to use these commands, just refer to our handy navigation guide below (Figure 3).

![image](./images/navigation.png)
###### Figure 3

Here is an example workflow to help you better understand the Navigation Guide (Figure 3) better:
1. Start at the Course Page where you see two modules displayed. 
2. Type `select 1` to view the groups of the first course. You'll be redirected to the `Group Page`. 
3. Choose to assign grades for `T15` group at index 1 by typing `task 1`. You'll be redirected to the `Task Page`.
4. You realize you made a mistake and want to mark attendance for the `T16` group instead. Simply type `back` and 
   you'll be redirected back to the `Group Page`. 
5. To view `Session Page` for `T16` group, type `session 2`. You'll be redirected to the `Session Page` for that group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` and angle brackets `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add course <COURSE>`, `COURSE` is a parameter which can be used as `add course CS2103T`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `[n/<NAME>] [p/<PHONE_NUMBER>]` can be used as `n/John Doe p/88886886` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `mark <INDEX>â€¦â€‹` can be used as `mark 1`, `mark 1,2,3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `back`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
